<h3>
Prior to taking Computer Science at the University of Georgia...
</h3>
I was <I>fairly </I> capable of using the basic elements of computers, especially Microsoft. 
I was apprehensive about taking the course because I am not particulary good at science; <b>however</b> I felt much better after reading Dr. Saleh's course objectives.
I listed the link to the <a HREF="CSCI 1100  Topics in Computing (Spring 2016)">course objectives!</a></p>

<p>
<h3>
In addition to the course objectives...
</h3>

The schedule of the course interested me.
